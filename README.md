- Hello there! I'm Rhavenya, a 21-year-old computer science student based in Brazil. With a passion for games, cybersecurity, and books, I'm eager to explore the exciting world of technology.
I'm currently honing my skills in Python, PHP, and Linux, with a particular interest in networking, fueled by my cybersecurity studies. Looking to collaborate on backend projects and games, I'm always open to new opportunities.
Feel free to reach out to me on Discord at Rhavenya.
Pronouns: She/Her
Fun fact: I'm a dog lover, chocolate enthusiast, and a big fan of Game of Thrones.
